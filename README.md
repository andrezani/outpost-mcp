**MCP server for [Outpost](https://outpostapi.dev)** — publish to X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram, Bluesky, and Threads directly from Claude, Cursor, or any AI agent.

Outpost is a unified social media publishing API. This MCP server wraps it as a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) tool, so your AI agent can post to social media as a first-class capability — no separate UI needed.

## Quick Start

### Claude Desktop

Add this to your `~/.claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outpost": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "outpost-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OUTPOST_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop — the Outpost tools will appear automatically.

### Custom API URL (self-hosted)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outpost": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "outpost-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OUTPOST_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "OUTPOST_API_URL": "https://your-outpost-instance.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Ask Claude:

Claude will:
1. Call `list_accounts` → find your X account ID
2. Call `get_capabilities` → verify character limits
3. Call `publish_post` → publish the content
4. Call `get_post_status` → confirm it went through
